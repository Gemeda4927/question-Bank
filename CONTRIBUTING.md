# Contributing

Thanks for contributing! Please:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch: `feature/<short-name>` or `fix/<short-name>`.
3. Run tests and linters before pushing.
4. Open a PR to `develop`.
5. Include a description of changes and screenshots if UI-related.

Code style: Use consistent formatting (Prettier for JS/TS, dartfmt for Flutter).
Testing: Add unit tests for new logic. CI will run tests on PRs.
